What is CSS?

<!--
CSS Syntax:
-----------
A CSS rule-set consists of a selector and a declaration block:
selector { decleration (property : value;) }

h1 {
    color: white;
    text-align: center;
    font-weight: bold;
}

The selector points to the HTML element you want to style.

The declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons.

Each declaration includes a CSS property name and a value, separated by a colon.

Multiple CSS declarations are separated with semicolons, and declaration blocks are surrounded by curly braces.
