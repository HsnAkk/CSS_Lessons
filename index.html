CSS Selectors:
--------------
CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:

    1. Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    2. Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
    3. Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
    4. Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
    5. Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
-->

Simple CSS selectors:
---------------------
    1- The CSS element Selector:
        The element selector selects HTML elements based on the element name.
        p { text-align: center;color: red;}
    
    2- The CSS id Selector:
        The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
        The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
        To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element. 
        
        NOTE: An id name cannot start with a number!

    3- The CSS class Selector:
        The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.
        To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

        NOTE: A class name cannot start with a number!

    4- The CSS Universal Selector:
        The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.
    
    5- The CSS Grouping Selector:
        The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
        Look at the following CSS code (the h1, h2, and p elements have the same style definitions):
        h1, h2, p { text-align: center;color: red; }
